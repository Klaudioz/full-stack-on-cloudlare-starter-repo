# Full-Stack SaaS on Cloudflare Workers

A comprehensive smart link shortening SaaS application demonstrating enterprise-level architecture built entirely on Cloudflare's edge platform. This project showcases how to build scalable, cost-effective SaaS solutions using modern microservices patterns.

## üöÄ What We're Building

This application creates a **smart link shortening service** (like Bitly, but smarter) with advanced features:

- **üåç Geographic Routing**: Route users to different destinations based on their location
- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Link Analysis**: Background services analyze destination pages for content quality and availability
- **üìä Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard with click tracking, geographic data, and performance metrics  
- **üí≥ SaaS Features**: Complete user authentication, payments integration, and subscription management
- **‚ö° Edge Computing**: Blazing fast performance with global edge deployment

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project demonstrates **service-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

### üì± User Application (`apps/user-application`)
**Responsibilities**: UI, Authentication, Basic CRUD Operations
- React frontend with TanStack Router & Query
- tRPC backend for type-safe APIs
- Better Auth for authentication & Stripe for payments
- Real-time WebSocket connections

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Service (`apps/data-service`) 
**Responsibilities**: Data Processing, AI Inference, Link Redirects
- Cloudflare Queues for async processing
- Durable Objects for stateful operations & WebSockets
- Workflows for complex multi-step jobs
- Browser Rendering for page analysis
- Workers AI for intelligent content evaluation

### üì¶ Data Operations Package (`packages/data-ops`)
**Responsibilities**: Shared Database Logic, Types, Schemas
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Shared utilities across services

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v8+  
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (included in project dependencies)
- **GitHub account** (required for deployment pipelines)
- **Cloudflare account** (free - sign up at [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com))

### Quick Start

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You must **fork** this repository (not just clone) to enable deployment features later in the course.

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account using the Fork button

2. **Clone your fork** (replace `YOUR_USERNAME`):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/full-stack-on-cloudlare-starter-repo.git
   cd full-stack-on-cloudlare-starter-repo
   ```

3. **Install all dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Build the DataOps package** (required first step):
   ```bash
   pnpm run build-package
   ```

5. **Start the frontend application**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev-frontend
   ```

6. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`

You should see the marketing landing page. Click "Get Started for Free" to view the dashboard with sample data.

### Alternative Development Approach

You can also work within individual applications:

```bash
# Navigate to specific app
cd apps/user-application

# Run development server directly
pnpm dev
```

This approach is useful when focusing on a single feature or service.

## üöÄ First Deployment

After getting the development server running, deploy immediately to understand the platform:

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

1. **Navigate to user application**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/user-application
   ```

2. **Deploy your application**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```

3. **First-time authentication**: 
   - Wrangler CLI will open your browser
   - Click "Allow" to grant access to your Cloudflare account

4. **Access your deployed app**:
   - You'll receive a URL like: `user-application.{your-name}.workers.dev`
   - Your app is now live on Cloudflare's global edge network!

### What Happens During Deployment

The deploy command:
- **Builds your application** (`npm run build`) into production-ready bundles
- **Uploads static assets** (JS, HTML, CSS) to Cloudflare's global CDN
- **Deploys Worker code** to handle server-side requests
- **Configures routing** based on your `wrangler.jsonc` settings

### Cloudflare Dashboard

After deployment, visit the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com):
- Navigate to **Workers & Pages** 
- Find your `user-application` deployment
- View metrics, logs, deployments, and configure settings
- Monitor real-time analytics and error traces

### Key Structural Notes

- **No root `src/` folder**: Each app maintains its own source directory
- **DataOps Package**: Must be built (`pnpm run build-package`) before apps can import shared code
- **Workspace Dependencies**: Apps reference shared packages with `workspace:*` in package.json
- **Independent Deployment**: Each app can be deployed separately to Cloudflare Workers
- **Generated Files**: `routeTree.gen.ts`, `auth-gen/`, and `dist/` folders are auto-generated

## üéì Learning Resources

- **Course Documentation**: Detailed explanations in each section
- **Code Examples**: Complete implementations for each feature
- **Reference Implementation**: [Final course repo](https://github.com/matthew-sessions/cf-services-the-course-playground) 
- **Cloudflare Docs**: [developers.cloudflare.com](https://developers.cloudflare.com/)

## üí° Getting Help

### Debugging Tips
1. **Check the reference repo** if you get stuck
2. **Use AI assistants** (Claude, Cursor) to debug specific issues
3. **Cloudflare Dashboard** provides excellent debugging tools
4. **Browser DevTools** for frontend issues

### Common Issues

- **"Cannot find module" errors**: Run `pnpm run build-package` to build the DataOps package
- **TypeScript binding errors**: Run `pnpm cf-typegen` after adding Cloudflare resources
- **Build failures**: Ensure all dependencies installed with `pnpm install` from project root
- **Port 3000 in use**: Kill existing processes or change port in vite.config.ts
- **Deployment authentication**: First deploy opens browser - click "Allow" for Wrangler access
- **Deployment failures**: Check authentication with `wrangler whoami`
- **Forking vs Cloning**: Must fork repository for deployment pipelines to work
- **Wrangler configuration**: `wrangler.jsonc` grows complex as features are added

## üöÄ Next Steps

After completing this course, you'll be equipped to:

- **Build Production SaaS Applications** on Cloudflare
- **Architect Scalable Systems** using microservices patterns
- **Integrate AI Features** into real-world applications  
- **Deploy Edge Applications** globally with confidence
- **Optimize for Cost and Performance** at scale
